An open bibliography of machine learning for formal proof papers.
All papers on machine learning applied to proof assistants are welcome here,
regardless of venue and quality.
Papers on machine learning for automated theorem provers are welcome
if and only if they are directly applicable to proof assistants,
and the connection to proof assistants is discussed explicitly in the paper.

This bibliography is nonexhaustive, and open to the public to add papers to.
To contribute, please submit a pull request.
It is perfectly fine to add your own papers.
